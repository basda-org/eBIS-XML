eBIS-XML Stylesheets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These stylesheets are alpha quality and they require refactoring to:

  - Take advantage of the eBIS-XML Component Library
  - Use a library of stylesheet components

These stylesheets are provided as-is in the hope that they may be useful, but
developers are advised to create stylesheets which match the look and feel of
their products.
